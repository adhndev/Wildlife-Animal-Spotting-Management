# Wildlife-Animal-Spotting-Management
A simple DBMS mini project website that helps the naturalist to add sightings of wild animals and the tourist to book and stay at the reserve.

This project is based on original data collected from Kabini Tiger Reserve by my friend and project partner Anruddh GS.

This project uses ports 80 and 443. MySQL was used to create the database.

There a few mail triggers in this code u can change it to your mail system by editing sendmail from your XAMPP files and set to your preferred mail server and sender mail ID.
I would recommend following these steps https://youtu.be/4_NP_WYFmIM
